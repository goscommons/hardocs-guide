# References and Inspiration

These are some of the references we have been using to conceptualize and implement hardocs.

## BOMAKE

It is a vue online app to make Bill of Materials(BOMs) using yaml files. The yaml files are translated to json and then to html and pdf dynamically. The idea behind this app is to make BOMs easy to version control using git.

## [Vuepress]()

## [Vuejs]()

## Gitbuilding

A package and command line interface for hardware documentation.

> Overarching idea is to have the least invasive syntax so you can essentially write the prose you want and the software will read a little bit of metadata you sprinkle in to generate the difficult things like bills of materials. The essential idea is you are good at writing instructions, the computer is good at counting and copying.

## [JSON schema store](http://schemastore.org/json/)

References of json schemas including [project schemas](http://json.schemastore.org/project).

## OpenKnowHow

The objective of this particular specification is

> to improve the open-ness of know-how for making hardware by improving the discoverability, portability and translatability of knowledge.
